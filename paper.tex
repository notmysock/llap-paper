\begin{abstract}
Apache Hive has turned SQL into a first-class citizen in the ecosystem surrounding Apache Hadoop.
In this paper, we introduce LLAP \footnote{Live Long And Process}, a new low latency column service 
part of Hive-2.0, designed to accelerate interactive SQL queries. LLAP is intended as an addition
to the existing execution engines to Hive, primarily interacting over ODBC/JDBC connectivity already
available as part of HiveServer2.

To maintain an interactive user experience, LLAP aims to respond to user input within the timescales
between 400ms to 4000ms, after which Business Intelligence tools use modal indicators which deny the 
user an interactive experience. As the latency of query runtimes approach the millisecond scale, 
several historical tradeoffs made in Hive have to be re-evaluated, in particular the overheads of
interacting with HDFS \& YARN become significant. Along with changing balance of these interactions, 
the evolution of compute, storage and networking hardware brings new opportunities to be taken
advantage of.

The quest for interactive performance however does not allow LLAP to sacrifice failure tolerance or 
multi-query concurrency, but forces one to develop efficient trade offs between latency and throughput 
as dependent user goals. LLAP's design draws from the experiences learned from deployments of scale of 
Apache Hive \& Apache Tez, which have been subject to the same pressures.


This paper is a discussion of considerations given to the design of LLAP based on experiments and the
boundaries within which LLAP offers a solution to the long tail of latency present in a multi-tenant
environment.
